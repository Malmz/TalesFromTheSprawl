### Module to allow one or more players to run a shop together.
# Having a shop grants:
# - A public storefront, where the menu/catalogue is presented as messages you can react to
# - An "orders" channel, showing what people have ordered recently
# - A "delivery ID" (e.g. table number) for each customer,
#   so that orders can be collected and delivered together
# - An "actor", with the functionality that comes with it (handles, financial reports, chats)
#   albeit restricted to a single handle
